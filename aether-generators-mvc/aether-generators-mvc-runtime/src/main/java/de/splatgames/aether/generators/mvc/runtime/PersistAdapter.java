/**
 * Minimal persistence abstraction used by generated builders when operating in a persistent mode.
 *
 * <p>This interface is intentionally small to remain framework-agnostic. Implementations may be backed by
 * any persistence technology (e.g., JPA, MyBatis, custom repositories, or a test double).
 * The adapter is expected to return managed/attached entities where applicable.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * // Example integration inside a builder's persistence step:
 * public final class RoleBuilder extends AbstractBuilder&lt;Role, RoleBuilder&gt; {
 *   private final PersistAdapter adapter;
 *
 *   public RoleBuilder(PersistAdapter adapter) {
 *     super(Mode.TRANSIENT);
 *     this.adapter = adapter;
 *   }
 *
 *   &#64;Override protected Role build() {
 *     Role r = new Role();
 *     r.setName(defaults.name());
 *     return r;
 *   }
 *
 *   &#64;Override protected Role persistIfNeeded(Role obj) {
 *     return adapter.save(obj); // return managed instance (e.g., with assigned ID)
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <h2>Transactions</h2>
 * <p>This abstraction does not establish transactional boundaries. Callers are responsible for
 * transaction demarcation (e.g., via an outer service layer or test setup).</p>
 *
 * <h2>Thread-safety</h2>
 * <p>Implementations should document their own thread-safety characteristics. The interface
 * itself imposes no synchronization requirements.</p>
