/**
 * Relation classification used by the code generator.
 *
 * <p>This enum describes whether a field participates in an object relationship and,
 * if so, whether the relation is single-valued or multi-valued. The classification
 * is derived from annotations encountered during processing (e.g., strings like
 * {@code "jakarta.persistence.OneToOne"}, {@code "jakarta.persistence.ManyToOne"},
 * {@code "jakarta.persistence.OneToMany"}, {@code "jakarta.persistence.ManyToMany"}),
 * or defaults to {@link #NONE} when no relation is detected.</p>
 *
 * <h2>Usage</h2>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * // Emission of builder API:
 * switch (field.relationKind()) {
 *   case NONE:
 *     // emit withX(...)
 *     break;
 *   case TO_ONE:
 *     // emit withX(...) or withXId(...) when asIdOnly=true
 *     break;
 *   case TO_MANY:
 *     // emit withX(...), addX(E), addAllX(Collection&lt;? extends E&gt;), clearX()
 *     break;
 * }
 *
 * // Pre-persistence handling (pseudo):
 * if (field.relationKind() == RelKind.TO_ONE) {
 *   ensurePersistent(getField(obj, field.name()), depth - 1, visited);
 * } else if (field.relationKind() == RelKind.TO_MANY) {
 *   for (Object e : getCollection(obj, field.name())) ensurePersistent(e, depth - 1, visited);
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <h2>Notes</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>{@link #NONE} means the field is treated like a scalar for code generation.</li>
 *   <li>{@link #TO_ONE} covers single-reference relationships (e.g., OneToOne / ManyToOne).</li>
 *   <li>{@link #TO_MANY} covers collection relationships (e.g., OneToMany / ManyToMany).</li>
 * </ul>
