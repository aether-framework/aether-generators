/**
 * Immutable descriptor of a domain field as seen by the code generator.
 *
 * <p>This record captures all metadata required to emit a fluent builder API and the corresponding
 * object construction logic (including defaults, collections, and relation handling).</p>
 *
 * <h2>Typical usage</h2>
 * <blockquote><pre>
 * // Collected from an entity type during annotation processing:
 * List&lt;FieldModel&gt; fields = collectFields(entityType, includeSuper, explicitPolicy);
 *
 * // Example of how this metadata drives API emission:
 * for (FieldModel f : fields) {
 *   String withName = "with" + capitalize(f.alias());
 *   // emit: public Builder withX(f.type() value) { ... }
 *   // if (f.isCollection()) also emit add/addAll/clear variants
 *   // if (f.asIdOnly() &amp;&amp; f.relationKind() == RelKind.TO_ONE) emit withXId(...)
 * }
 * </pre></blockquote>
 *
 * <h2>Semantics &amp; constraints</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><strong>alias</strong> is the API-facing base name used for fluent methods (e.g. {@code withAlias(...)}).
 *       It may differ from {@code name} (e.g., boolean fields starting with {@code is...}).</li>
 *   <li><strong>setterName</strong> is the exact Java setter the generator attempts to call; if not
 *       available, field assignment may be performed via reflection.</li>
 *   <li><strong>isCollection / isList / isSet</strong> are mutually consistent flags describing the field shape.
 *       When {@code isCollection} is {@code true}, {@code elementType} holds the collection's element type
 *       (or {@code Object} if unknown/erased).</li>
 *   <li><strong>asIdOnly</strong> indicates that a relation should be exposed as an identifier in the
 *       builder API (e.g. {@code withEmployeeId(...)}) instead of an object reference.</li>
 *   <li><strong>relationKind</strong> classifies the field as {@code NONE}, {@code TO_ONE}, or {@code TO_MANY}
 *       for pre-persistence relation handling.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Thread-safety</h2>
 * <p>This type is a Java {@code record} and therefore immutable and thread-safe by design.</p>
