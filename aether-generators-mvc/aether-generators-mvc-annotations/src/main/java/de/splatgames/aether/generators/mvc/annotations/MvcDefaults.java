/**
 * Marks a class as a defaults provider for generated builders.
 * <p>
 * A defaults provider is a simple class with zero-arg methods returning default values used
 * by the builder when a field is not explicitly set. Example:
 * </p>
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * @MvcDefaults
 * public class RoleDefaults {
 *   public String roleName() { return "USER"; }
 *   public boolean isDefault() { return false; }
 * }
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>
 * The processor will try to instantiate this class reflectively using a no-arg constructor.
 * You can also reference a provider directly via {@link MvcBuilder#defaultProvider()}.
 * </p>
