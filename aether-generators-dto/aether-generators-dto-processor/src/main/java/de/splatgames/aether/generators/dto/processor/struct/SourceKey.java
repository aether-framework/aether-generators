/**
 * Stable map/set key for grouping annotated members by their declaring source type.
 * <p>
 * A {@code SourceKey} encapsulates a {@link TypeElement} and its fully qualified name (FQN).
 * Equality and hash code are deliberately based <strong>only</strong> on the FQN, making the key
 * robust across annotation processing rounds and independent of {@code TypeElement} identity
 * semantics. The original {@code TypeElement} is retained for diagnostics and as an originating
 * element when emitting generated sources.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h2>Intended usage</h2>
 * <p>
 * The DTO processor uses {@code SourceKey} as the key in a map from source types to the lists
 * of annotated fields. This ensures deterministic grouping and avoids subtle issues caused by
 * comparing {@code TypeElement} instances from different rounds or utilities.
 * </p>
 *
 * @implNote
 * This key treats nested classes by their canonical FQN as returned by
 * {@link TypeElement#getQualifiedName()}. Two keys are considered equal if and only if their FQNs
 * are equal as strings.
